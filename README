AK7802 USB Flashing Tool
========================

This is a tool that implements the USB boot protocol of the Ankya AK7802 (and
similar -- perhaps AK78xx and AK88xx) processors. The protocol has been
reverse-engineered from BurnTool.exe traffic dump.

It can be used to replace the system firmware or restore the stock one.

See flash-ce.sh for an example of how to use it to flash back the stock
firmware provided you get hold of the right images.
